	<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

	<p>8x7 Kevin is a mental arithmetic game. </p>
    <p>You chose the number of operations you want to do (3x3 = 9 operations, 4x4 = 16 operations, 5x5 = 25 operations), the level (1 chilli = easy, 2 chillies = medium, 3 chillies = difficult) and operators you want to use. You can also choose one of the 3 modes (standard, uncompleted, equation) at the right bottom of the screen. Then you just have to press the green triangle to play.</p>

    <p>The number of successfull operations and the spent time are displayed at the right bottom of the screen. If you validate the page (green check sign), you may have the best score for this configuration (biggest number of successfull operations, and in case of egality, smallest spent time). In that case, you can enter your name or anything else (8 characters max). The best record for the current configuration is displayed at the left bottom of the screen. If you leave the page (red cross), you just go back to the home page.</p>

    <p>On the home page, you can choose to display comments or not (french or english).</p>
